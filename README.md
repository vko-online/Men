This is a modification to the MEAN stack generated by the [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) [MEANjs generator](https://github.com/meanjs/generator-meanjs) version 0.1.12 which was provided by [MEANjs.org](http://meanjs.org/). This modification adds local token authentication capabilities as an alternative to local cookie based authentication using sessions. 

## Welcome
Welcome to Whitehall Technologies LLC's open source project adding token based local authentication to the base MEANjs.org deployment of the MEAN.js stack. Please visit our [site](http://www.whitehall.io) for more info and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/castlewhitehall) and [GitHub](https://github.com/castlewhitehall) for live updates.

## Token Authentication
Token authentication is an alternative to cookie based authentication and is has a number of benefits.

* Cross-domain / CORS: cookies + CORS don't play well across different domains. A token-based approach allows you to make AJAX calls to any server, on any domain because you use an HTTP header to transmit the user information.

* Stateless (a.k.a. Server side scalability): there is no need to keep a session store, the token is a self-contanined entity that conveys all the user information. The rest of the state lives in cookies or local storage on the client side.

* CDN: you can serve all the assets of your app from a CDN (e.g. javascript, HTML, images, etc.), and your server side is just the API.

* Decoupling: you are not tied to a particular authentication scheme. The token might be generated anywhere, hence your API can be called from anywhere with a single way of authenticating those calls.

* Mobile ready: when you start working on a native platform (iOS, Android, Windows 8, etc.) cookies are not ideal when consuming a secure API (you have to deal with cookie containers). Adopting a token-based approach simplifies this a lot.

## Build Instructions

This guide assumes you have a MongoDB running locally on port 27017. If not, follow these [instructions](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/).

* Update the local package list and download Git, Node.js, and the Node Package Manager

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

* Create a symbolic link between nodejs and node (some older programs that use node call it through 'node' instead of 'nodejs')

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
```

* Install Grunt Task Runner

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

* Clone the project and navigate into it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/castlewhitehall/meanjs-with-token-auth.git
cd meanjs-with-token-auth/
```

* Install Node packages
```bash
npm install
```

## Deployment and Use
* Run the following to deploy the server using nodemon. If files are changed, then it will automatically restart.
```bash
grunt
```

* tests
```
grunt test
```

## Additions and Modifications

Same as https://github.com/castlewhitehall/meanjs-with-token-auth but working

* Added sign out
```javascript
Users.sign_out(function(successResponse){
        Authentication.user = null;
        localStorage.removeItem('a');
        delete $http.defaults.headers.common.Authentication;
        // Redirect to signin page
        $location.path('/signin');
    }, function(errorResponse){
        $scope.error = errorResponse.message;
});
```

* Socket.js
```javascript
var socketio = req.app.get('socketio');
socketio.sockets.in(utils.get_id(req.user)).emit('notification', 'Hello');
```
* VK-passport


8 Angular side token consumption
```javascript
request: function(config){
    var auth = localStorage.getItem('a');
    if(auth){
        config.headers.Authentication = auth;
    }
    return config;
}```
